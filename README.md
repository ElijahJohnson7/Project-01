So for this project I wanted to design a home page for a website based on an artist I like. I tried to cater the overall design to the aesthetic that they usually aim for to keep everything consistent. This goes for the text in all elemnts, the color scheme, and the types of images I included. I tried to add music too but for some reason the audio was being really finicky and I couldn't get it to work (apparently it works on Glitch but not the website itself...ok then). To be honest, there were too many parts in this project that I found overly annoying, but I don't think that's the fault of the assingment. It's just how web design is it seems. Trying to format the page for one device, and then having it look wrong on another one is just one of the few things that went wrong in my project. And it still isn't really finished in that sense, since I have no clue how to do any form of responsive web coding. There is also an issue with the page where there is like an extra half of it on the vertical axis that iis just blank space. I think it has something to do with the way I used the flex boxes, but I just couldn't figure it out so yeah. My hopes are that we'll be able to use this initial project for the larger project towards the end of the semester, as I think I can make something pretty cool out of this.
